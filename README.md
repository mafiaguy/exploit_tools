# SubDomain Scanner

#This is an ongoing project which will be a website containig all the exploit tools I create for penetration testing purpose for the hackers. 

About the subdomain tool:-
Finding subdomains of a particular website let you explore the full domain infrastructure of it. Building such a tool is really handy when it comes to information gathering phase in penetration testing for ethical hackers.

Searching for subdomains manually would take forever,so I build this subdomain scanner in Python using requests library. And then created a RestAPI using FASTAPI and connected it to the  Frontend.  


## Steps to Run

# Backend-
First open the sub_domain_check folder and then follow the steps

1. virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4. python run.py(it is running at port 8003 if you change it you also have to change it in the fronend)

# Forntend-
Open the sub_domain_check_frontend folder
steps-
1.npm i
2. npm start 

website will start at 127.0.0.1:3000

# Enter the Domain 
eg:- google.com

# Enter a list for subdomains using comma
eg:- www,api,mail,test

# Click on Run

Then within few second you will get a response.
